            <h2>Good Skincare</h2>
            <p>Imagine your skincare routine as a <b>superhero cape</b> for your skin. By spending just a few minutes each day cleaning away dirt and oils, you're giving it the superpowers it needs to stay <b>healthy and happy</b>. But here's the secret ingredient: <b>consistency</b>. Like leveling up in a game, you gotta stick with it to see those awesome results. Let’s talk about morning skincare routine for <b>teenagers</b> who have <b>OILY COMBINATION</b> skin types:</p>

                        <h2>Wash your face with water</h2>
                        <p>First off, start by splashing your face with water. It's crucial to clear away the dirt and oil that gathers while you sleep. However, cleanser isn’t needed in the morning; lukewarm water works best.                <p>

                        <h2>Toner</h2>
                    <p> Depending on their ingredients, toners can help hydrate the skin or remove leftover oil and dirt. The primary goal of using a toner is to <b>enhance the effectiveness</b> of skincare products used afterwards. For best results, apply the toner on slightly <b>damp skin</b> and allow it to absorb for <b>five minutes</b> before applying any additional products. It's crucial to note that teenage skin is highly sensitive, so every product used must be specifically formulated for <b>sensitive</b> skin. <p>

                          <h2>Serum (Optional)</h2>
                            <p>Once you've applied toner, it's time to show your skin some extra love with a serum that matches your skin type and concerns. Serums come in all shapes and sizes, and they work magic in different ways. Got dry skin? Reach for a moisturizing serum. Dealing with acne scars? Try antioxidant serums like vitamin C, or niacinamide. Remember, everyone's skin is unique, so feel free to tweak this step or skip it altogether if it doesn't suit your vibe. For dealing with acne scars I recommend Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum. <p>

                                <h2>Moisturizer</h2>
                                <p>At night, our skin can get pretty thirsty and parched. This step is super crucial, especially if you're in a dry climate, like Mongolia. Whether you're dealing with acne or oily skin, every inch of your skin deserves some hydration. Massaging a moisturizer into your face and neck keeps your skin protected and hydrated all day. <p>

                                    <h2>Sunscreen</h2>
                                    <p>One key step in your morning skincare routine is applying sunscreen. It's super important because without it, those sun rays can really wreak havoc on your skin. Plus, if you live in harsh environments, like Mongolia and Siberia, it's extra crucial to protect your skin. And here's a bonus: sunscreen also helps your other skincare products stay put throughout the day by acting as a barrier. It's recommended to reapply sun cream every two hours. I suggest trying Skin Aqua sunscreen because it not only provides high SPF protection but also moisturizes your skin. <p>
