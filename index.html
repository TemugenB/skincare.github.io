            <ul>
                <li>Don't pick, squeeze, or pop pimples. If you leave your acne alone, it will typically clear up on its own within a few days, but if you squeeze it, you risk causing permanent damage to the pore, which can leave scar on your face <b>FOREVER.</b></li>
                <li>Try not to touch your face. </li>
                <li>If you have long hair, keep it away from your face and wash it regularly to reduce oil.</li>
                <li>Change pillowcase at least every 3 days (use towel and rotate it)</li>
                <li>Wash body after washing the hair to prevent from body acne</li>
            </ul> 
            <h4>Don't give up if you don't see results the next day. It can take weeks or months to work.</h4>
